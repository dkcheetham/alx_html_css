# ALX Advanced CSS Project

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on applying advanced HTML and CSS concepts to build a visually appealing and responsive web page layout based on a Figma design.

## Requirements

- Use only HTML and CSS (No external libraries or frameworks).
- All files must end with a new line.
- Ensure the code validates with [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- The structure of the site must follow the layout provided in the Figma design.
- Project images are available in the `images/` folder within the project directory.
- Fonts used: `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT`.

## Figma Design and Assets

- Figma Design Page: [View Original Design](https://www.figma.com/design/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=rmfyyAZsKjEYcV6s-0)  
  _Make sure you're logged in and click **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to inspect and work with the design._

- Fonts used:
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro)

> _Note: Some values in the Figma file are floats — feel free to round them during implementation._
